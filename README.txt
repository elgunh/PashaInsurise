# Landing Page Project

This project contains the front-end code for a landing page. It includes the following folders:

- `src`: This folder contains the source code for the landing page. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- `dist`: This folder contains the distribution or production-ready files generated from the source code. These files are optimized for deployment.
- `slick`: This folder contains the Slick carousel library, which is used for creating responsive and customizable carousels or sliders on the landing page.
