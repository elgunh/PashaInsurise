# Pasha Insurize 2.0

## Overview

Insurize 2.0 is a project developed during the Pasha Life hackathon. The aim of this project is to predict the success of life insurance sales based on various factors. The implementation uses Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive and exploratory analysis.

## Features

- *Normalized Datasets:* Two normalized datasets were obtained from real-life insurance companies. These datasets include encoded information on employment history, medical history, medical keywords (diagnosis), family history, age, height, BMI, and details about life insurance projects.

- *Prediction Models:* The code includes a model for predicting whether a life insurance sale will be successful or not. Additionally, a proposed model is provided for further exploration and improvement.

- *Visualizations for Pitch Deck:* Many visually powerful graphs have been added to enhance the understanding of the data. These graphs can be utilized in a pitch deck or presentation to convey insights effectively.
